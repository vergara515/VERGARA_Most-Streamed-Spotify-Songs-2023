# Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023

In this exploratory data analysis (EDA), a dataset about the popular tracks on Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023 is explored along with its various musical attributes and their relationship to popularity metrics like the number of streams. An initial exploration provided summary statistics, focusing on key features such as release dates, BPM, and danceability which helped understand the different features available. Through visualizations like bar charts and scatter plots, trends and patterns are uncovered that reveal insights into what makes a track successful. Finally, correlations between musical characteristics and streams are also investigated, offering recommendations to better understand the dynamics of popular music.

## Overview of Dataset

Understanding the structure and content of the dataset is an essential part of doing an analysis. This involves checking the number of rows and columns, reviewing data types, and identifying any missing values that might require cleaning.

### a. How many rows and columns does the dataset contain?

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f1139a6-3cdb-4f12-aa6b-10963d8fe90c)

_Functions:_

1. **data.shape**

   > Description: The 'data.shape' function is used to know how many rows and columns the dataset has in 'data'.

2. **print()**
  
   > Description: This function prints the statement inside it.

_Analysis:_

The dataset contains 953 tracks (rows) which all have 24 unique attributes or features (columns).

### b.1. What are the data types of each column? 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f017319a-dcf3-4992-a875-ed2262c44c65)

_Functions:_

1. **data.dtypes**

   > Description: The 'data.dtypes' function is used to reflect the data type of each column.

**Note:** In this dataset, the data types 'object' represents text or mixed data, 'int64' represents a 64-bit integer, and 'float64' represents a 64-bit float point number. 

_Analysis:_

There are a lot of 'int64' data types of columns. Second to it is the 'object' data type and then the least occurring data type would be 'float64'.

### b.2. Are there any missing values?

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5cfcc8f0-0756-4489-9ff6-918245dfd886)

_Functions:_

1. **data.isnull()**

   > Description: This function checks for any missing values in each column of the dataset with True in places where values are missing and False where they are present.

2. **.sum()**

   > Description: This function '.sum()' then adds up the True values (where there are missing values) for each column, giving a count of missing values per column.

3. **print()**
  
   > Description: This function prints the statement inside it.

_Analysis:_

There are missing values in some columns, such as 1 is missing for streams, 50 are missing for in_shazam_charts, and 95 are missing in key. Accordingly, these missing values may affect how the data could be interpreted as a different interpretation may be concluded.

## Basic Descriptive Statistics

In this section, insights into the dataset's numerical and categorical features are extracted. By understanding central tendencies in the streams column and exploring distributions of released_year and artist_count, potential trends or outliers are identified.

### a. What are the mean, median, and standard deviation of the streams column?

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc7ab7a1-61ab-4c43-a476-bd571535735d)

_Functions:_

1. pd.to_numeric(data['streams'])

   > Description: This function is used to convert the values in the streams column to a numeric type.
   
2. errors = 'coerce'

   > Description: This parameter prevents the function from throwing an error when encountering problematic entries.

**Note:** This line of code was added since there are texts in the stream column that are not allowed when getting the mean, median, and standard deviation. Therefore, this will prevent that error and allow the codes to get the mean, median, and standard deviation run.

_Functions:_

1. **data['streams'].mean()**

   > Description: This function gets the mean in the dataset named 'data' which is limited to its 'streams' column only.

2. **print()**
  
   > Description: This function prints the statement inside it.

_Functions:_

1. **data['streams'].median()**

   > Description: This function gets the median in the dataset named 'data' which is limited to its 'streams' column only.

2. **print()**
  
   > Description: This function prints the statement inside it.

---

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edbe2d24-c8f1-4194-b76b-0fb5d54ff090)

_Functions:_

1. **data['streams'].std()**

   > Description: This function gets the standard devation in the dataset named 'data' which is limited to its 'streams' column only.

2. **print()**
  
   > Description: This function prints the statement inside it.

_Analysis:_

The data shows that, on average, each song has about 514 million streams, but the median has 291 million streams. This suggests that a some songs get a huge number of streams, which pulls the average up. The standard deviation of around 566 million then means thereâ€™s a lot of variation in stream counts across songs. Essentially, most songs have fewer streams than the average, but a small number of hits have very high counts, creating an uneven spread.

### b.1. What is the distribution of released_year and artist_count?

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4ec5439-8ac9-4da4-a74f-10b25facd439)

_Functions:_

1. **plt.figure(figsize = (5, 5))**

   > Description: This function initializes the figure for the plot with a specific size of 5 inches wide and 5 inches tall.

2. **sns.histplot(data['released_year'], bins = 30, kde = True)**

   > Description: The function **"sns.histplot(data['released_year']"** makes the 'released_year' from the data into a histogram.

   > Description: The parameter **"bins = 30"** determines the number of intervals or "bins" for grouping in years.

   > Description: The parameter **"kde = True"** enables the Kernel Density Curve (KDE) curve.

3. **plt.title('Distribution of Released Year')**

   > Description: This function allows the plot to have a title "Distribution of Released Year".

4. **plt.xlabel('Released Year')**

   > Description: This function labels the x-axis as "Released Year", representing the years in which the tracks were released.

5. **plt.ylabel('Tracks')**

   > Description: This function labels the y-axis as "Tracks", representing the count of tracks released in the specific interval of years.

_Analysis:_ 

It can be observed that as more time progresses, more tracks are being released through the years. A sharp increase during the 2010 and especially after 2020 reflects the growing volume of music releases in recent years, as well as the focus of the dataset on more recent tracks since earlier years have very few tracks.

_Functions:_

1. **plt.figure(figsize = (5, 5))**

   > Description: This function initializes the figure for the plot with a specific size of 5 inches wide and 5 inches tall.

2. **sns.histplot(data['artist_count'], bins = 30, kde = True)**

   > Description: The function **"sns.histplot(data['artist_count']"** makes the 'artist_count' from the data into a histogram.

   > Description: This function allows the plot to have a title "Distribution of Artist Count".

4. **plt.xlabel('Released Year')**

   > Description: This function labels the x-axis as "Artist Count", representing the years in which the tracks were released.

5. **plt.ylabel('Tracks')**

   > Description: This function labels the y-axis as "Tracks", representing the count of tracks released in the specific interval of years.

_Analysis:_ 

The graph suggests that as the artist count increases, the less tracks are there. This pattern reveals that tracks with solo artist are more dominant in the dateset than those tracks with collaboration of multiple artists. 

### b.2. Are there any noticeable trends or outliers?

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2258254-7856-4385-b9de-46d10a0e3768)

_Functions:_

1. **plt.figure(figsize = (12, 6))**

   > Description: This function initializes the figure for the plot with a specific size of 12 inches wide and 6 inches tall.

2. **sns.boxplot(x=data['released_year'])**

3. **plt.title('Boxplot of Released Year')**

   > Description: This function allows the plot to have a title "Boxplot of Released Year".

4. **plt.xlabel('Released Year')**

   > Description: This function labels the x-axis as "Released Year", representing the data on track for release years.

_Analysis:_

As shown in the box plot, multiple outliers are observed. This is because most tracks are from the 2020 and only a few tracks are from the earlier years. The big difference from the number of tracks in the recent years are evidently more compared to the earlier years which cause the outliers.
