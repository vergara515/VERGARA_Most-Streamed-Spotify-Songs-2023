Author: Vergara, Revie Shane D.

---

In this exploratory data analysis (EDA), a dataset about the popular tracks on Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023 is explored along with its various musical attributes and their relationship to popularity metrics like the number of streams. An initial exploration provided summary statistics, focusing on key features such as release dates, BPM, and danceability which helped understand the different features available. Through visualizations like bar charts and scatter plots, trends and patterns are uncovered that reveal insights into what makes a track successful. Finally, correlations between musical characteristics and streams are also investigated, offering recommendations to better understand the dynamics of popular music.

### b.1. What are the data types of each column? 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f017319a-dcf3-4992-a875-ed2262c44c65)

_Functions:_

1. **data.dtypes**

   > Description: The 'data.dtypes' function is used to reflect the data type of each column.

**Note:** In this dataset, the data types 'object' represents text or mixed data, 'int64' represents a 64-bit integer, and 'float64' represents a 64-bit float point number. 

_Analysis:_

There are a lot of 'int64' data types of columns. Second to it is the 'object' data type and then the least occurring data type would be 'float64'.

### b.2. Are there any missing values?

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5cfcc8f0-0756-4489-9ff6-918245dfd886)

_Functions:_

1. **data.isnull()**

   > Description: This function checks for any missing values in each column of the dataset with True in places where values are missing and False where they are present.

2. **.sum()**

   > Description: This function '.sum()' then adds up the True values (where there are missing values) for each column, giving a count of missing values per column.

3. **print()**

   > Description: This function gets the standard devation in the dataset named 'data' which is limited to its 'streams' column only.

2. **print()**
  
   > Description: This function prints the statement inside it.

_Analysis:_

The data shows that, on average, each song has about 514 million streams, but the median has 291 million streams. This suggests that a some songs get a huge number of streams, which pulls the average up. The standard deviation of around 566 million then means thereâ€™s a lot of variation in stream counts across songs. Essentially, most songs have fewer streams than the average, but a small number of hits have very high counts, creating an uneven spread.

### b.1. What is the distribution of released_year and artist_count?

   > Description: The function **"y='streams'"** specifies the column from avg_streams_by_key to be used for the y-axis, representing the average number of streams for each key.

6. **plt.title("Average Streams by Key")**

   > Description: This function allows the plot to have a title "Average Streams by Key".

7. **plt.xlabel("Key")**

   > Description: This function labels the x-axis as "Key", representing the keys.

8. **plt.ylabel("Average Streams")**

   > Description: This function labels the y-axis as "Average Streams", representing the number of tracks per key.

_Analysis:_

Based on the bar plot, there are no evident patterns among the tracks. However, it can be observed that sharper keys tend to have higher average streams compared to its base keys. It also noticeable that the C# key has the most average keys.

_Functions:_

1. **streams_by_mode = data.groupby('mode')['streams'].mean().reset_index()**

   > Description: The function **"data.groupby('mode')['streams']"** represents the mode of each track and computes the average number of streams for each mode.

   > Description: The function **".mean()"** calculates the mean (average) number of streams for each mode.

   > Description: The function ".reset_index()" cleans data set where the mode and the corresponding average streams are both columns. 

32. **plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))**

   > Definition: This function initializes the figure for the plot with a specific size of 8 inches wide and 5 inches tall.

3. **sns.barplot(data=streams_by_mode, x='mode', y='streams')**

   > Description: The function **"sns.barplot(data=streams_by_mode"** creates a bar plot about the data set stored in **"streams_by_mode"**.

   > Description: The function **"x='mode'"** specifies the column from streams_by_mode to be used for the x-axis, representing the modes.

   > Description: The function **"y='streams'"** specifies the column from streams_by_mode to be used for the y-axis, representing the average number of streams for each mode. 

4. **plt.title("Average Streams by Mode (Major vs. Minor)")**

   > Description: This function allows the plot to have a title "Average Streams by Mode (Major vs. Minor)".

5. **plt.xlabel("Mode")**

   > Description: This function labels the x-axis as "Mode", representing the mode (Major or Minor).

6. **plt.ylabel("Average Streams")**

   > Description: This function labels the y-axis as "Average Streams", representing the number of tracks per mode.

_Analysis:_

Based on the bar plot, Minor mode are more streamed compared to Major mode. In other words, people tend to enjoy more somber emotional quality of music than bright and happy ones.

_Functions:_

1. **artist_playlist_counts = data['artist(s)_name'].value_counts().reset_index()**

   > Description: The function **"data['artist(s)_name']"** contains the names of the artists.

   > Description: The function **".value_counts()"** counts how many times each unique value appears in a specified column.
   
   > Description: The function **".reset_index()"** used to reset the index of the resulting Series from value_counts().

   > All together, they are stored in variable **"artist_playlist_counts"**

2. **artist_playlist_counts.columns = ['artist', 'playlist_count']**

   > Description: The function **".columns"** refers to the column names of the data.

3. **top_artists_playlists = artist_playlist_counts.head(10)**

   > Description: The function **"artist_playlist_counts"** contains data about artists and how many playlists they are featured in.

   > Description: The function **".head(10)"** returns the first 10 rows of the artist_playlist_counts.

   > All together, they are stored in variable **"top_artists_playlists"**.

4. **plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))**

   > Description: This function initializes the figure for the plot with a specific size of 12 inches wide and 6 inches tall.

5. **sns.barplot(x='playlist_count', y='artist', data=top_artists_playlists)**

   > Description: The function **"sns.barplot()"** creates a bar plot about the **top_artists_playlists**.

   > Description: The function **"x='playlist_count'"** represents how many playlists the artistâ€™s tracks appear in.

   > Description: The function **"y='artist'"** represents the artists.

   > Description: The function **"data=top_artists_playlists"** defines the data source for the plot.

6. **plt.title('Top 10 Artists by Playlist Appearances')**

   > Description: This function allows the plot to have a title "Top 10 Artists by Playlist Appearances".
   
7. **plt.xlabel('Number of Playlists')**

   > Description: This function labels the x-axis as "Number of Playlists", representing the number of playlists per artist.

8. **plt.ylabel('Artist')**

   > Description: This function labels the y-axis as "Artist", representing the artist.

_Analysis:_

Based on the bar plot, certain genres or artists do consistently appear in more playlists or charts as they have multiple tracks on the data set provided. Accordingly, the most frequently appearing artists in playlists or charts would be Taylor Swift with around 34 tracks.

## Recommendation

After performing analyzations and through observations, there seems to be missing data in the data set. The missing data could affect the result or how some results could be interpreted; thus, the recommendation would be to fill or research the missing values as it could greatly affect interpretations. Additional insights on what makes a track popular would be the artists. Some artists in the data set are well-known and being famous greatly affects the popularity of a track as more people or fans would listen to it. Moreover, tracks mostly streamed are in these recent years, especially 2020, as through time, naturally, musical trends shift and tracks are being made based on that so people would stream it more.
